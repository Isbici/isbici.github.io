    <h1>Sandhill Cranes 2021</h1>
	<img src="images/sandhill-cranes.png" alt="Three sandhill cranes">
	<p>When my parents lived in Sarasota, Florida, they took pictures of the sandhill cranes. I found a watercolor painting on the internet and tried to paint a copy of it for them.</p> 
	<p>In particular I was happy with three things about the painting:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The coloring and interesting shape of the birds</li> 
	<li>The wetlands where they like to live</li>
	<li>The third bird is showing off happy and proud</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My next animal painting hopefully will be the elephant done by Louise De Masi.</p>
